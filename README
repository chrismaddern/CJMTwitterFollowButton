Follow Me Button for iOS

A UIButton-based class which will open a Twitter profile in the user's Twitter App of choice (iOS5 Twitter functionality favoured).

This can be used in Interface Builder by adding a UIButton and changing it's class to FollowMeButton or in code using the custom initialiser:

[self.view addSubview:[[FollowMeButton alloc] initWithTwitterAccount:@"chrismaddern" atOrigin:CGPointMake(205, 248) isSmallButton:YES]];

Two size modes are available controlled by setting isSmallButton in the initialiser or by later change the isSmall property of the object.

NOTE: This was created for use with ARC. If you do not use ARC, then set the compiler flag '-fobjc-arc' on the file in the 'Compile Sources' build phase.
 
This is basically several others' work pulled together to create a simple-to-include repo.
